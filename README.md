## 🧩 Project Overview
The Olipop Next.js project is a rebuild of the customer-facing landing page. It features a sophisticated hero section with a scroll-controlled 3D product rotation (parallax), interactive flavor variant switching, and modular content sections (Reviews, Ingredients, Nutrition). The architecture is designed to be "production-ready," utilizing Server Components where possible and Client Components for interactivity.

## 🎯 Objectives & Goals
- **Modernization:** Migrate legacy HTML/JS to Next.js 16 App Router architecture.
- **Performance:** Optimize asset loading (specifically heavy image sequences) and improve Core Web Vitals.
- **Type Safety:** Implement strict TypeScript across all components and hooks.
- **Maintainability:** Componentize the UI using React enabling easier updates and AB testing.
- **UX Excellence:** Replicate and smooth out the detailed parallax interactions and animations.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Hero animation uses exactly 200 frames for optimal load/quality balance.
- Hero section stays fixed (z-0) while content sections scroll over it (z-10).
- Variant switching (Cherry, Grape, Lemon) updates all relevant UI elements (Hero image, Colors, Product section image) instantly.
- Buttons and layout are fully responsive down to mobile devices (375px width).
- No hydration errors or console warnings in the final build.

## 💻 Prerequisites
- **Node.js:** Version 20.x or higher
- **Package Manager:** npm (v10+) or pnpm
- **Git:** For version control
- **OS:** Windows, macOS, or Linux

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd olipop-nextjs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## 🔗 API Documentation
*Note: This project is primarily a frontend application. However, it interfaces with external storage for assets.*

- **Asset Source:** Supabase Object Storage
- **Endpoint Pattern:** `[BaseUrl]/[FrameNumber].webp`
- **Hook Interface (`useImagePreloader`):**
  - Input: `variant: Variant`
  - Output: `{ frames: HTMLImageElement[], isLoading: boolean, progress: number }`

## 🖥️ UI / Frontend

### Structure & State Flow
- **Global State:** `VariantContext` wraps the application layout, managing the `currentVariant` state globally.
- **Hero Component:** `ParallaxHero` consumes context to display the correct image sequence. It controls the window scroll interaction.
- **Content Sections:** `ProductSection`, `IngredientsSection`, etc., consume context to update content dynamically based on the selected flavor.

### Key Components
| Component | Path | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| ParallaxHero | src/components/hero/ParallaxHero.tsx | Manages the scroll-driven frame animation (400vh height). |
| VariantSwitcher | src/components/hero/VariantSwitcher.tsx | Handles user input for changing flavors. |
| ProductSection | src/components/sections/ProductSection.tsx | Displays "Our Story" with dynamic product imagery. |

## 🔢 Status Codes
Application logic handles the following internal states:
- **Loading (0-99%):** `isLoading: true` in `useImagePreloader`. Blocks interaction.
- **Ready (100%):** `isLoading: false`. Unlocks scroll and reveals interface.
- **Error:** Failed asset loads trigger console errors but attempt to degrade gracefully.

## 🚀 Features
- **3D Parallax Scroll:** Smooth scrubbing through 200 high-res frames as the user scrolls.
- **Dynamic Theme Engine:** Background colors and asset paths switch instantly based on variant selection.
- **Asset Preloading:** Custom hook ensures smooth playback by pre-fetching image sequences.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS v4 breakpoints.
- **Component Encapsulation:** ShadCN UI primitives used for standard elements like Accordion and Separators.

## 🧱 Tech Stack & Architecture
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.x
- **UI Library:** React 19.2
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 + PostCSS
- **Animation:** Framer Motion + Native Scroll Events
- **Validation:** Zod
- **Assets:** WebP sequences hosted on Supabase

## 🛠️ Workflow & Implementation
1. **Setup:** Initialized Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
2. **Data Modeling:** Defined `Variant` types and configured asset sources in `variants.ts`.
3. **Core Logic:** Implemented `useImagePreloader` to handle heavy asset fetching and `useParallax` for scroll calculations.
4. **Component Construction:** Built modular sections (Hero, Product, FAQ) using ShadCN UI primitives.
5. **State Integration:** Created `VariantContext` to link the Hero switcher with downstream sections.
6. **Refinement:** Adjusted Parallax timing (Extended height to 400vh) to fix overlap issues.
7. **Optimization:** Reduced frame count from 240 to 200 for better performance.

## 🧪 Testing & Validation
| ID | Area | Command / Action | Expected Output | Status |
|----|------|------------------|-----------------|--------|
| T-01 | Core | `npm run dev` | Server starts on port 3000 without error. | 🟢 PASS |
| T-02 | Parallax | Scroll down 3000px | Animation plays smoothly through frame 200 before content covers it. | 🟢 PASS |
| T-03 | Responsiveness | Resize width to 375px | Buttons stack vertically, layout adjusts to single column. | 🟢 PASS |
| T-04 | State Management | Click "Next" variant | Hero color, hero image, and "Our Story" product image update simultaneously. | 🟢 PASS |
| T-05 | Production Build | `npm run build` | Build completes with valid static generation and no lint errors. | 🟢 PASS |

## 🧰 Verification Testing Tools
The following tools were used to verify the integrity of the implementation:
- **ESLint:** Static code analysis for finding problems.
- **TypeScript Compiler (tsc)::** Type checking verification.
- **Browser DevTools:** Network throttling and z-index visualizer.
- **Browser Subagents:** Automated navigation and DOM inspection agents used during development.

## 🧯 Troubleshooting & Debugging
- **Issue: Hydration Mismatch.** *Fix:* Ensured no browser-extension specific attributes were interfering, and synchronized server/client rendering logic.
- **Issue: Next Section Overlap.** *Fix:* Increased Hero section height from 300vh to 400vh to accommodate the full 200-frame animation sequence.
- **Issue: Missing Images.** *Fix:* Verified Supabase URLs and configured `next.config.ts` (if needed for external domains, though basic `img` tags were used for raw frames).

## 🔒 Security & Secrets
- No sensitive API keys are exposed in the client bundle.
- Asset URLs are public and read-only.
- `next.config.ts` is configured to be secure by default.

## ☁️ Deployment (Vercel)
The project is optimized for Vercel deployment:
1. Push code to GitHub.
2. Import project in Vercel Dashboard.
3. Framework Preset: **Next.js**.
4. Build Command: `next build`.
5. Install Command: `npm install`.
6. Click **Deploy**.

## ⚡ Quick-Start Cheat Sheet
```bash
# Start Dev Server
npm run dev

# Build for Prod
npm run build

# Lint Code
npm run lint
```

## 🧾 Usage Notes
- Ensure a stable internet connection for asset loading (images are fetched from remote storage).
- The parallax effect relies on scroll events; extensive throttling is applied for performance, but very fast scrolling may skip frames visually.

## 🧠 Performance & Optimization
- **Lazy Loading:** Content sections below the fold are standard React components.
- **Image Optimization:** WebP format used for all animation frames.
- **Memory Management:** `useImagePreloader` manages the buffer to prevent memory leaks, though caching is leveraged for smoothness.
- **Code Splitting:** Next.js App Router automatically splits routes and components.

## 🌟 Enhancements & Features
- **Context API:** Introduced `VariantContext` to decouple component communication.
- **Z-Index Layering:** Architectural change to allow content to "slide over" the fixed hero background.

## 🧩 Maintenance & Future Work
- **Future:** Add more flavors by simply updating `variants.ts`.
- **Future:** Implement a backend CMS for dynamic text updates.
- **Maintenance:** Regularly update `npm` dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

## 🏆 Key Achievements
Successfully transformed a static concept into a scalable, interactive application. Maintained high visual fidelity while introducing strict engineering practices (Type safety, CI/CD readiness).

## 🧮 High-Level Architecture
The application follows a standard Next.js App Router topology. `page.tsx` serves as the composition root for the homepage, injecting the `ParallaxHero` and subsequent `sections`. Data flows unidirectionally from the `variants` configuration file into the state context, which then distributes it to subscribers.
